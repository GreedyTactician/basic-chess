# basic-chess

This project is a learning experience for me on various topics:
- C++
- OpenGL/GLFW
- ImGui
- Sol2
- CMake
- Declarative code/functional code


You have two options to run the game. 
1. If you have LOVE installed, go to basic-chess/chess and open a terminal. Type 'love .'
2. Build the C++ project (cmake . && make) and ./app

There is a small menu that you can show/hide with ESC. Otherwise, this works as you would expect from a normal chess game.
