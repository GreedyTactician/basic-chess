# basic-chess

This project is a learning experience for me on various topics:
- C++
- OpenGL/GLFW
- ImGui
- Sol2
- CMake
- Declarative code/functional code

and even git/github itself!

You have two options to run the game. 
1. If you have LOVE installed, go to basic-chess/chess and open a terminal. Type 'love .'
2. Build the C++ project (cmake . && make) and ./app
